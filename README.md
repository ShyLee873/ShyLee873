# 🌙 Oh hi👋

I'm Shy, a Ruby on Rails & JavaScript dev based in North Carolina.

I love building things that make people think, smile, or learn. Whether it’s backend systems, interactive React apps, or tiny weird side-projects that somehow turn into full features.
If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll prototype it, break it a few times, rebuild it, and ship it.

Right now, I’m deep into designing delightful, secure, and scalable experiences across full-stack Ruby on Rails, React, and modern JavaScript.


## My Tech Stack:

Backend: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Sidekiq

Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML, SCSS

Testing: RSpec, Capybara, Selenium, Playwright

Other: CSP/Security hardening, API design, Agile workflow, debugging wizardry


## Fun Facts About Me:

- I spend my free time crafting, hiking, and gaming...unless I’m learning something new

- I love to sing (loudly, happily, and often)

- I’m powered by green tea and Diet Pepsi
